    <h1>My Dearest Love</h1>
    <p>From the very first moment you entered my life, something shifted in me — like a silent storm passing through my soul, clearing away everything that once felt dull or ordinary. Suddenly, everything had meaning. The stars looked brighter, love songs started to make sense, and every heartbeat echoed with your name. You’ve become the poetry that runs through my veins, the peace I crave in chaos, the warmth I feel even in the coldest nights. You are not just a part of my world — <span class="highlight">you are my world</span>, my heart’s home, the most beautiful chapter in my story, the reason I now believe in destiny.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder how someone like me got so incredibly lucky to cross paths with someone as gentle, kind, strong, and breathtakingly beautiful as you. You shine in ways I can’t fully explain — not just with your smile, but with your soul, your heart, your way of making even the darkest days feel light. Your love has transformed me in ways I never imagined. I am not just in love with you — <span class="highlight">I am deeply, endlessly, profoundly moved by you</span>. Your presence is my favorite feeling. Your voice is the calm in my storm. Your laughter is the song my heart longs for, and your eyes... they hold galaxies I could get lost in forever.</p>

    <p>Even though distance separates us physically, it has only brought our hearts closer. Every sunrise reminds me that we are under the same sky. Every sunset whispers your name. When I close my eyes, I can still feel your touch, hear your laugh, and imagine the way your hand would fit perfectly into mine. I miss you in a way that words can’t fully carry — not just your presence, but the moments we haven't yet lived: the quiet mornings, the spontaneous adventures, the long talks under the stars, the ordinary days that become extraordinary just because you're in them.</p>

    <p>I want it all with you. The wild, beautiful, messy, real life. I want to be the one who supports your dreams, lifts your spirit, protects your heart, and makes you feel like the most loved woman on this planet. I want to build a future where we don't have to count the miles between us anymore — where I can wake up every morning and fall in love with you all over again. I want to hold you when you’re tired, dance with you when you're happy, and stand by your side through every joy and every storm. <span class="highlight">You and me — hand in hand, heart to heart, forever.</span></p>

    <p>Please know this: no matter how long we must wait, no matter how far we must reach, my love for you will never fade. It doesn’t depend on time or distance. It lives in every beat of my heart, every breath I take, every dream I dream. <span class="highlight">You are the reason I believe in miracles.</span> You are the love I never saw coming and the one I’ll never stop choosing. Forever won’t be enough with you — but it’s where I want to start.</p>

    <p class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px;">I love you — more deeply than the ocean, more endlessly than the stars, and more truly than words could ever say.</p>
